# Timer and Date Demo Project.

## This is a super simple project to test out Docker and NGINX on my AWS EC2
- You can run this locally if you clone the repo it and run npm install and ng serve (but you will need NPM).
- You can build it using the dockerfile and run it (assuming you have docker)
- You can use the docker-compose to run it instead (if you have docker compose)
- Finally you can use the docker:image from docker hub if you wanted to run it at your website.
